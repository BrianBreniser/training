Self-insured group health plan administered by contract with third-party administrator. The third-party administrator has been hired to process claims under the plan. The third-party administrator does not serve as an insurer, but merely as a claims processor. Claims for benefits are sent to the third-party administrator. It processes the claims, then requests and receives funds from Employer to pay the claims, and makes payment on the claims to hospitals and other providers. Employer is ultimately responsible for providing plan benefits, and not the third-party administrator.

The Medical Review Manager will certify all such medical care that is determined to be Medically Necessary or suggest other care options that may exist for treatment of the condition. For Inpatient admissions, the Medical Review Manager will also certify the number of days of confinement that are considered to be Medically Necessary. If the attending Health Care Practitioner feels, due to extenuating circumstances, that additional days are required to treat the condition properly, he or she may contact the Medical Review Manager to discuss the Medical Necessity of an extended length of stay and request certification for additional days. Any medical care or confinement

that is not determined to be Medically Necessary will not be certified and will not be eligible for benefits. The Medical Review Manager will notify the Covered Person promptly of its determination. It will also notify the Medical Facility or Behavior Health Facility and the Covered Person's Health Care Practitioner.

If the Covered Person, or his/her Health Care Practitioner, does not agree with the decision of the Medical Review Manager, the decision may be appealed according to the appeal provisions listed in the Claim Provisions section.

## Maternity Management Program

Upon confirmation of a pregnancy, all expectant mothers are asked to participate in a maternity management program aimed at keeping the Covered Person and the unborn child healthy. The primary objective of the maternity management program is to anticipate the possibility of a high or moderate risk pregnancy and help coordinate effective medical care.

It is highly recommended, but not a requirement of the Plan, that expectant mothers call the Medical Review Manager during the first trimester of pregnancy, or upon confirmation of pregnancy. At this time, a Registered Nurse (RN) will ask questions about the expectant mother's general health and medical history. This information will be discussed with the Covered Person's Health Care Practitioner to help determine the risk factor of the pregnancy.

No preauthorization is required. To participate, contact the Medical Review Manager using the toll free number for medical services that require prior authorization, located on Your identification (ID) card.

If You or Your Covered Dependents are having trouble locating a Participating Provider or Participating Pharmacy, please contact the network listed on Your identification (ID) card.

The Covered Person's benefits may also be affected based on the following factors:

- 1. Providers, pharmacies and/or networks may join or leave the Participating Provider Network or Participating Pharmacy Network from time to time. The Covered Person is responsible for verifying the participation status of a provider/pharmacy at the time of service. Prior to treatment, the Covered Person should call the Network Manager to verify whether a provider or pharmacy's participation in the network has terminated.

A Covered Person is responsible for the portion of the bill not covered by the Plan, in addition to any other applicable fees including, but not limited to, any Coinsurance, Copayment, and Deductible.

## Specialty Pharmaceuticals

Most Specialty Pharmaceuticals that are parenteral drugs, which are received on an Outpatient basis through a method other than self-administration, are covered under the Medical Benefits section; call the Plan Administrator to verify benefits.

For coverage under this Outpatient Prescription Drug Benefits section for any Specialty Pharmaceuticals that are obtained through a Pharmacy for self-administration, a Covered Person must obtain authorization before the Specialty Pharmaceutical is considered for possible coverage. Participating in a

Specialty Pharmacy Program may also be required for coverage. If the Specialty Pharmaceutical is authorized, the Covered Person will be advised how the Specialty Pharmaceutical can be obtained from a Specialty Pharmacy Provider and how to file a claim.

For a Covered Person's first-time use of any Specialty Pharmaceutical, we may limit Our authorization to an initial 15-day treatment regimen. If the treatment regimen is continued, additional supply may be authorized.

If a Specialty Pharmaceutical is covered under this Outpatient Prescription Drugs Benefits section, and the Covered Person has Specialty Pharmaceutical Prescription Drugs filled at a Pharmacy that is not a Specialty Pharmacy Provider, the Covered Person must pay for the Specialty Pharmaceutical Prescription Drug in full at the Pharmacy. The Covered Person will not be reimbursed.

Under this Outpatient Prescription Drugs Benefits section, Covered Charges Incurred for Specialty Pharmaceutical Prescription Drugs obtained from a Pharmacy that is not a Specialty Pharmacy Provider are not covered, and will not apply toward satisfying any Out-of-Pocket Limit.

(Rev. 08/2022)

- 4. When a covered Prescription Drug is available under two or more names, dosages, dosage forms, dosage regimens or manufacturers' packaging or when more than one covered Prescription Drug may be used to treat a condition that would be covered under this Plan, the Plan will consider benefits only for the most cost effective drug, dosage form or packaging that would be a Covered Charge under this Plan and that will produce a professionally adequate result.When using a Mail Service Prescription Drug Vendor, the vendor will fill the covered Prescription Order and mail it along with a replacement order form to the Covered Person. It will be mailed to the Covered Person's home or another location that is designated by the Covered Person. Some medications may have shipping restrictions.

## Identification Cards

In connection with this benefit, You will receive an identification (ID) card for You and Your Covered Dependents to use while covered under this Plan.

No benefits are payable for any Prescription Order filled for a Covered Person on or after the date his or her coverage terminates under this Plan. Thus, all Covered Persons are required to turn in their ID card or cards to the Plan at the time of coverage termination. If You fail to do so and any Covered Person uses the ID card after coverage ends, You are responsible for all Prescription Drugs purchased after the termination date. We will recover from You any amounts paid by the Plan for drugs purchased after coverage terminates under this Plan.

## How To File A Claim

Present Your ID card with the Prescription Order at the Pharmacy each time a Prescription Order is filled at a Participating Pharmacy. Pay the Participating Pharmacy the difference between the charge for the covered Prescription Drug and the amount the Plan will pay. This applies to each covered Prescription Drug that is filled at a Participating Pharmacy. If the ID card is not used to obtain Prescription Drugs at a Participating Pharmacy, the Covered Person must pay the Participating Pharmacy the entire amount charged for the covered Prescription Drug. Complete a prescription drug claim form. Send it and any Prescription Drug receipts to the Prescription Card Service Administrator (PCSA) at the address shown on the form for reimbursement of Covered Charges. A prescription drug claim form can be obtained from the Plan.

At a Non-Participating Pharmacy, the Covered Person must pay the Pharmacy the entire amount charged for the covered Prescription Drug. The Covered Person will not be reimbursed.

## Miscellaneous Provisions

The amount paid by the Plan under this section may not reflect the ultimate cost for the Prescription Drug. Any amounts that the Covered Person is responsible for paying are paid on a per prescription or refill basis and will not be adjusted if any retrospective volume drug discounts or Prescription Drug rebates under any portion of this Plan are received.

Manufacturer product discounts, also known as rebates, may be provided and may be related to certain drug purchases under this Plan. These amounts will not be refunded to You.

Payment by the Plan for a Prescription Drug under this section does not constitute any assumption of liability for coverage of a Sickness or an Injury under the Medical Benefits section. It also does not constitute any assumption of liability for further coverage of the Prescription Drug under this section.

(Rev. 08/2022)

For the purpose of the Coordination Of Benefits section, the Outpatient Prescription Drug Benefits section will be considered a separate medical plan, as defined in the Coordination Of Benefit section, and will be coordinated only with other Prescription Drug coverage. We will not provide any benefits for Prescription Drug charges that are paid by another medical plan defined in the Coordination Of Benefit section as the primary payor.

The Covered Person is responsible for any Prescription Drug Coinsurance , Coinsurance, Prescription Drug Copayment or Prescription Drug Deductible, and/or Deductible that is paid for a Prescription Order that is filled, regardless of whether the Prescription Order is revoked or changed due to adverse reaction or changes in dosage, dosage regimen or Prescription Order.

## X. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB)

You or Your Covered Dependents may have coverage under more than one plan. If benefits are available through any other Medical Plan, We will take those benefits into account in calculating the amount of Covered Charges that may be payable by Us so that benefits from both Us and any other Medical Plan are limited to the actual charges Incurred.

If a Covered Person is entitled to benefits provided by another Medical Plan but does not claim them, We will consider the benefits to which a Covered Person is entitled as benefits that were provided. All claims should be submitted to Us and all other Medical Plans at the same time so that proper benefits can be determined and paid.

## Coordination Of Benefits Definitions

For purposes of this section, in addition to any specific terms that are defined under the general Definitions section of this Plan, the following capitalized terms have the meanings given below:

- 1. Allowable Charge: Any charge which is a Covered Charge under this Plan and is, at least in part, covered under any other Medical Plan. If a Medical Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, We will determine a reasonable cash value for each service that is provided and that cash value will be considered the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the other Medical Plan. The difference between an Acute Medical Facility's semi-private room rate and private room rate is not an Allowable Charge unless the private room is Medically Necessary. Benefit reductions due to failure to comply with Medical Plan provisions of the Primary Plan are not an Allowable Charge. If both the Primary Medical Plan and the Secondary Medical Plan have contractual discount arrangements, the Allowable Charge will be determined by applying the greater of the two discounts.
- 2. Coordination of Benefits (COB): Coordination of Benefits (COB) means that benefits are paid so that no more than 100% of the Allowable Charges for which the Covered Person is liable will be covered under the combined benefits received from all Medical Plans.
- 3. Insured: The person in whose name the Medical Plan is in force.
- 4. Medical Plan: Any Medical Plan which provides medical or dental benefits or services including, but not limited to:
- a. Group, blanket or franchise insurance that provides major medical benefits.
- b. Group-type insurance which can be obtained and maintained only as the result of membership in or connection with a specific group or organization.
- c. A service plan or contract, group or individual practice or other prepayment plan.
- d. Any employer or employee self-insurance plan.
- e. Coverage arranged by or through any trustee, union, employer or association.
- f. The medical or dental benefits coverage in group, group-type and individual automobile "no-fault" and traditional automobile "fault" type contracts (but only where permitted by law) or other medical or dental pay coverage.
- g. Health coverage, whether issued or administered on a group or individual basis.
- h. Group Blue Cross, group Blue Shield, group practice or prepaid group coverage.

- i. Coverage under trust or association plans or plans sponsored by unions, employer groups, or employee benefit groups.
- j. Medical coverage under automobile or no fault insurance, if coordination of benefits with such coverage is allowed by law.
- 5. Primary Medical Plan: A Medical Plan in which benefits must be determined without considering the benefits of any other Medical Plan. A Medical Plan is primary if:
- a. The Plan either has no rules for determining the order of benefits or has rules which differ from the rules in this Plan; or
- b. According to the Order of Benefit Determination provision, the Plan considers its benefits first.
- 6. Secondary Medical Plan: A Medical Plan in which benefits are determined after the benefits of the Primary Medical Plan have been determined.

## How Benefits Are Paid

If We are the Primary Medical Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provision in this section, We will pay benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this Plan without regard to this COB section.

If We are the Secondary Medical Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provision below, We will pay the lesser of:

- 1. The difference between the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the Primary Medical Plan; or
- 2. Benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this Plan without regard to this COB section.

When We are the Secondary Medical Plan, the benefits payable under this Plan will be reduced to the extent necessary so that when Our benefit payments are added to the benefits payable under all other Medical Plans, they do not exceed the total Allowable Charge for any services or equipment.

## Order Of Benefit Determination

The Primary Medical Plan and Secondary Medical Plan are determined by using the following rules. Whichever rule below is the first to apply to the Covered Person's situation is the rule that will be used to determine which Medical Plan is the Primary Medical Plan and which is the Secondary Medical Plan.

- 1. A Medical Plan that does not have a COB provision, or has a provision that differs from this one, pays its benefits first.
- 2. A Medical Plan that covers the person as the Insured pays its benefits before a Medical Plan that covers the person as a dependent.
- 3. For a child whose parents are not divorced or separated:
- a. The Medical Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day only) falls earlier in the year pays its benefits first. It does not matter which parent is older.

(Rev. 08/2022)

- b. If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the Medical Plan covering the parent for the longer time period pays its benefits first.
- c. If one Medical Plan has this birthday rule and the other Medical Plan does not and, as a result, the Medical Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the Medical Plan that does not have the birthday rule pays its benefits first.
- 4. For a child whose parents are separated or divorced:
- a. If a court decree establishes which parent is responsible for the child's medical or dental expenses, the Medical Plan of that parent pays its benefits before any other Medical Plan that covers the child as a dependent. This applies only if the Medical Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree.
- b. Otherwise, the Medical Plan of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Medical Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody; and the Medical Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Medical Plan of the parent without custody.
- c. If a court decree establishes joint custody, without stating which one of the parents is responsible for the medical or dental expenses of the child, the Medical Plans covering the child will follow the rules in item 3 above.
- 5. A Medical Plan that covers the person as the Insured, who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before those of a Medical Plan covering the person as a laid off or retired Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured. However, if the other Medical Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Medical Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply.
- 6. If a person is covered under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law and is also covered under another Medical Plan, the Medical Plan covering the person as the Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before the Medical Plan providing the continued coverage.
- 7. If none of the above rules apply, the Medical Plan covering the person for the longer time pays its benefits first.

## Rights Under This Section

We have the right to:

- 1. Release or obtain claim information from any Medical Plan, individual or entity.
- 2. Pay Our covered benefits to any Medical Plan or entity which has paid benefits that We should have paid.
- 3. Recover any overpayment made by the Plan from the person or entity to whom the payment was made.

We may obtain or release any information needed to carry out the intent of this section. You must inform the Plan if You or Your Covered Dependents have coverage under any other Medical Plans when the Covered Person makes a claim.

(Rev. 08/2022)

## Medicare As Secondary Payor

Under federal law, Medicare is often the secondary payor for Coordination of Benefits purposes if an individual has other coverage in addition to Medicare.

The rules require coverage under other coverage before Medicare when:

- 1. You and/or Your covered Dependent spouse is age 65 or older and Your Employer employs at least 20 persons (including part-time Employees) for a minimum of 20 weeks during the current or preceding Year.
- 2. You and/or Your covered Dependent is under age 65 and is receiving Medicare benefits due to a disability and Your Employer has at least 100 people actively employed on 50 percent or more of the regular business days in the preceding year.
- 3. A Covered Person is covered under an employer group health plan, is under age 65 and is eligible for Medicare due to end-stage renal disease. In this case, Medicare is usually secondary to coverage under the Plan for 30 months from the date of your Medicare eligibility.

This section regarding Medicare as a secondary payor may not apply to Your Employer. Please contact Your Employer to determine whether this section applies to the Plan.

(Rev. 08/2022)

## XI. CLAIM PROVISIONS

## Proof Of Loss

Most providers will file claims directly with the Plan. You are responsible for filing a claim with Us if the provider does not file it. The following provisions tell You how to file claims with the Plan.

We must receive written or electronic notice of the services that were received due to a Sickness or an Injury for which the claim is made. Notice must be provided to the Plan, via the Third Party Administrator identified in the Plan Administration Information section of the SPD, within 60 days after a covered loss occurs or as soon as reasonably possible. Proof of loss and sufficient information to process the claim must be received by the Plan within 180 days after the termination date of the Plan Year listed on Your Benefit Summary. Any claim denied for failure to file within the 6 months may be reconsidered if circumstances beyond the claimant's control resulted in a delayed filing by the provider.

The proof of loss must include all of the following:

- 1. Your name, identification number and group number.
- 2. The name of the Covered Person who Incurred the claim.
- 3. The name and address of the provider of the services.
- 4. An itemized bill from the provider of the services that includes all of the following as appropriate:
- a. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes.
- b. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedures.
- c. Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.
- d. Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) level II codes.
- e. National Drug Codes (NDC).
- 5. A statement indicating whether the Covered Person has coverage for the services related to the Sickness or Injury under any other insurance plan or program. If the Covered Person has other coverage, include the name and identification number of the other coverage.

When the Plan receives written or electronic proof of loss, the Plan may require additional information. You must furnish all items the Plan decides are necessary to determine the Plan's liability in accordance with the Right to Collect Information provision in this section. We will not pay benefits if the required information or authorization for its release is not furnished to the Plan.

## Right To Collect Information

To determine the Plan's liability, the Plan may request additional information from a Covered Person, Health Care Practitioner, facility, or other individual or entity. A Covered Person must cooperate, and assist the Plan by obtaining the following information within 45 days of Our request. Charges will be denied if the Plan is unable to determine liability because a Covered Person, Health Care Practitioner, facility, or other individual or entity failed to:

- 1. Authorize the release of all medical records to the Plan and other information as requested.

- 2. Provide the Plan with information requested about pending claims, other insurance coverage or proof of Creditable Coverage.
- 3. Provide the Plan with information as required by any contract with the Plan or a network including, but not limited to, repricing information.
- 4. Provide the Plan with information that is accurate and complete.
- 5. Have any examination completed as requested by the Plan.
- 6. Provide reasonable cooperation to any requests made by the Plan.

Such charges may be considered for benefits upon receipt of the requested information, provided all necessary information is received prior to expiration of the time allowed for submission of claim information as set forth in this Claims Provisions section.

## Physical Examination

We have the right to have a Health Care Practitioner of Our choice examine a Covered Person at any time regarding a claim for benefits or when authorization is requested under the Utilization Review Provisions section. These exams will be paid by Us. We also have the right, in case of death, to have an autopsy done where it is not prohibited by law.

## Payment Of Benefits

When We receive due written proof of loss, benefits for services provided by a Non-Participating Provider will be paid to the Covered Person unless they have been assigned to a Health Care Practitioner, facility or other provider. We pay Participating Providers directly for Covered Charges. Any benefits unpaid at Your death will be paid at Our option to Your spouse, Your estate or the providers of the services.

We will pay medical claims when coded according to the latest editions of the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) manual or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) manual. We will not pay for: charges that are billed separately as professional services when the procedure requires only a technical component; or charges that are billed incorrectly or billed separately but are an integral part of another billed service, as determined by Us; or other claims that are improperly billed; or duplicates of previously received or processed claims.

Submitted charges may be applied to the Covered Person's Deductible without review. Application of the charges to the Deductible does not guarantee future coverage of similar expenses. We reserve the right to review any and all claims for eligibility for coverage at the time each claim is submitted. You may request a review while claims are being applied to the Deductible by calling or writing to the Plan.

Any amount We pay in good faith will release Us from further liability for that amount. Payment by Us does not constitute any assumption of liability for coverage of a Sickness or an Injury. It also does not constitute any assumption of liability for further coverage. Any benefit paid in error may be recovered from You or the person or entity receiving the incorrect payment. We may offset the overpayment against future benefit payments.

## Timely Redemption of Payment

To the extent any claims payment check remains uncashed after 12 months from the date the check was issued, or if a payment issued by other means is unredeemed after 12 months from the date the payment was issued, the claim shall be deemed denied upon the expiration of such 12 month period.  To the extent the claim is denied in accordance herewith, and You or the provider to whom You assigned benefits submit a timely appeal of that denial (in accordance with the appeal procedures set forth in this SPD), the claim may be reconsidered.

## Rights Of Administration

The Plan maintains Our ability to determine Our rights and obligations under this Plan including, without limitation, the eligibility for and amount of any benefits payable.

## Claims Involving Fraud Or Misrepresentation

Claims will be denied in whole or in part in the event of misrepresentation or fraud by a Covered Person or a Covered Person's representative. If benefits are paid under this Plan and it is later shown the claims for these benefits involved fraud or misrepresentation, the Plan will be entitled to a refund from You, the Beneficiary or the person receiving the payment.

A claim will not be honored if the Covered Person or the provider of the charges will not, or cannot, provide adequate documentation to substantiate that treatment was rendered for the claim submitted. If the Covered Person, or anyone acting on the Covered Person's behalf, knowingly file a fraudulent claim, claims may be denied in whole or in part, coverage may be terminated or rescinded, and the Covered Person may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.

## Claims Provisions Definitions

For purposes of this section, in addition to any specific terms that are defined under the general Definitions section of this Plan, the following capitalized terms have the meanings given below:

- 1. Claim Involving Urgent Care: Any claim for medical care or treatment with respect to which the application of the time periods for making non-Urgent Care determinations (a) could seriously jeopardize Your life or health or Your ability to regain maximum function or (2) in the opinion of a Health Care Practitioner who has knowledge of Your medical condition, which subjects You to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the claim.
- 2. Pre-Service Claim: Any claim for a benefit with respect to which the terms of the SPD condition receipt of the benefit, in whole or in part, on approval of the benefit in advance of obtaining medical care.
- 3. Post-Service Claim: Any claim for a benefit that is not a Pre-Service Claim.
- 4. Adverse Benefit Determination: Any denial of a benefit, reduction of a benefit, termination of a benefit, or failure to pay (in whole or in part) for a benefit. This term includes any benefit denial, benefit reduction, benefit termination, or failure to pay, that:
- a. Is based upon a determination of a participant's or beneficiary's eligibility to participate in the Plan;
- b. Results from the usage of any Utilization Review Process; or

- c. Fails to cover an item or service for which benefits are otherwise provided based upon a determination that the item or services is an Experimental Or Investigational service or is not Medically Necessary or appropriate.

We may offset the overpayment against future benefit payments.

In addition, if the Plan makes any payment that, according to the terms of the Plan, should not have been made, the Plan Administrator or the Employer (or designee) may recover that incorrect payment, whether or not it was made due to the third-party administrator's or Plan Administrator's (or its designee's) own error, from the person to whom it was made or from any other appropriate party. As may be permitted in the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator, the refund or repayment may be made in one or a combination of the following methods: (a) in the form of a single lump-sum payment, (b) as a reduction of the amount of future benefits otherwise payable under the Plan, (c) as automatic deductions from pay (to the

## Subrogation Right

Subrogation is the process by which the Plan seeks reimbursement from another person or entity for a claim the Plan has already paid. When benefits are paid on a Covered Person's behalf under this Plan, We are subrogated to all rights of recovery

a Covered Person has against any person, entity or other insurance coverage. This includes, but is not limited to, recoveries against:

- 1. A third party.
- 2. Any liability coverage for a third party.
- 3. Other insurance that a Covered Person has, including uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage.

This subrogation right extends to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment but is limited to the amount of benefits the Plan has paid.

## A Covered Person must:

- 1. Do nothing to prejudice or hinder any right of recovery; and
- 2. Execute and deliver any instruments and papers that may be required by the Plan; and
- 3. Cooperate with the Plan to assist Us in securing Our subrogation rights.

If a Covered Person brings a lawsuit or other proceeding to recover damages in connection with a Sickness or an Injury for which the Plan has paid benefits, You or Your attorney must provide the Plan with copies of all pleadings, notices and other documents and papers that are related to Our subrogation right under this Plan. The Plan reserves the right to intervene in any proceeding in which a Covered Person is a party to the extent that such intervention is reasonably necessary to protect Our subrogation right.

Upon recovery of any portion of Our subrogation interest by way of settlement or judgment, the Plan will not be required, under any circumstances, to pay a fee to the Covered Person's attorney or share in any costs incurred by the Covered Person and/or the Covered Person's attorney in bringing about the settlement or judgment. If We engage an attorney or other agent for the purpose of enforcing Our subrogation right, We will be entitled to an award of Our costs including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees associated with all trial and appellate proceedings.

A Covered Person is not obligated by this provision to seek legal action against any person or entity for recovery of benefits paid under this Plan.

If the Plan is precluded from exercising Our subrogation right, We may exercise Our Right to Reimbursement provision in this Plan.

## Right To Reimbursement

When We pay benefits under this Plan, We have the right to recover an amount equal to the amount the Plan paid if the Covered Person:

- 1. Seeks recourse against any person, entity or other insurance coverage by suit, settlement, judgment or otherwise; and
- 2. Recovers payment, in whole or in part, from any person, entity or other insurance coverage for the benefits that We previously paid under this Plan.

This right to reimbursement extends to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment. This includes, but is not limited to, recoveries against:

- 1. A third party.
- 2. Any liability coverage for a third party.
- 3. Other insurance that a Covered Person has, including uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage.

Reimbursement to the Plan will not exceed either the amount of benefits that the Plan paid which the Covered Person

recovered from any other person, entity or other insurance coverage or the amount recovered from any other person, entity or other insurance coverage as payment for the same Sickness or Injury, whichever is less.

You must reimburse the Plan for any payments that We make prior to a determination as to whether a Sickness or an Injury is work-related at the time that the Covered Person receives payment for the Sickness or Injury from another source. You must agree to:

- 1. Notify the Plan of any workers' compensation claim that a Covered Person makes; and
- 2. Reimburse the Plan even when workers' compensation benefits are provided by means of a settlement or compromise.

- 3. Cooperate with the Plan to assist Us in securing Our right to reimbursement.

The Covered Person must provide the Plan with timely written notification in the event that he or she suffers a Sickness or an Injury in which a third party might be responsible and the Covered Person seeks recourse against any person, entity or other insurance coverage by suit, settlement, judgment or otherwise.

Such a notice must inform the Plan of:

- 1. The nature of the Sickness or Injury; and
- 2. The names, addresses and phone numbers of any insurance companies or other third parties who may be responsible for payment of damages suffered by the Covered Person; and
- 3. A description of the Accident or occurrence that the Covered Person reasonably believes was responsible for the Sickness    or Injury at issue and the approximate date(s) upon which such Accident or occurrence happened; and
- 4. The name of any legal counsel retained by a Covered Person in connection with any such Accident or occurrence.

If a Covered Person brings a lawsuit or other proceeding to recover damages in connection with any such Accident or occurrence, You or Your attorney must provide Us with copies of all pleadings, notices and other documents and papers that are related to Our right to reimbursement under this Plan. We reserve the right to intervene in any proceeding in which a Covered Person is a party to the extent that such intervention is reasonably necessary to protect the Plan's right to reimbursement.

Upon recovery of any portion of the Plan's right to reimbursement interest by way of settlement or judgment, We will not be required, under any circumstances, to pay a fee to the Covered Person's attorney or share in any costs incurred by the Covered Person and/or the Covered Person's attorney in bringing about the settlement or judgment. If We engage an attorney or other agent for the purpose of enforcing Our right to reimbursement, We will be entitled to an award of Our costs including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees associated with all trial and appellate proceedings.

A Covered Person is not obligated by this provision to seek legal action against any person or entity for recovery of benefits paid under this Plan.

## Workers' Compensation Not Affected

Coverage under this Plan does not replace or affect any requirements for coverage by workers' compensation insurance. If state law allows, the Plan may participate in a workers' compensation dispute arising from a claim for which We paid benefits.

(Rev. 08/2022)

## XIII. CONTINUATION

If You or any Covered Dependents are no longer eligible for coverage under this Plan, coverage may be continued. Your Plan will inform You of the right of continuation.

## Federal Continuation Rights

Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 as enacted, and later amended contains federal requirements for coverage.

COBRA federal legislation applies to any employer, except the federal government and religious organizations, which:

- 1. Maintains a group health plan; and
- 2. Employed 20 or more full-time equivalent employees on more that 50% of its typical business days during the preceding year.

Under this section, 'Qualified Beneficiary' means any person who, on the day before any event which would qualify him or her for continuation under this section, is covered for group health benefits under this Plan as: (a) an active, Covered Employee; or (b) the spouse or dependent of an active, Covered Employee. A Child born to, or placed for adoption with, the Covered Employee during a continuation period is also a Qualified Beneficiary.

## If Group Health Benefits End

In general, if group health benefits for a Qualified Beneficiary end due to termination of employment or reduction of work hours, the Qualified Beneficiary may elect to continue such benefits for up to 18 months, unless employment is terminated due to gross misconduct.

## Disabled Qualified Beneficiaries

In general, if a Qualified Beneficiary is determined to be disabled under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act on or during the first 60 days after the date his or her group health benefits would otherwise end due to termination of employment or reduction of work hours, the Qualified Beneficiary and/or any family member who is a Qualified Beneficiary may elect to extend the 18 month continuation period explained above for up to an additional 11 months.

To elect the 11 month extension of continuation, a Qualified Beneficiary must give the Employer written proof of the Social Security's determination of the disability before the earlier of: (a) the end of the initial 18 month continuation period; or (b) 60 days after the date the Qualified Beneficiary is determined to be disabled. If, during the 11 month extended continuation period, the Qualified Beneficiary is determined to be no longer disabled under the Social Security Act, he or she must notify the Employer within 30 days of such determination, and continuation will end.

## Death While Covered

If the Covered Employee dies while covered, any Qualified Beneficiary whose group health benefits would otherwise end may elect to continue such benefits. The continuation can last up to 36 months.

## Divorce Or Legal Separation

Upon legal divorce or legal separation, any Qualified Beneficiary whose group health benefits would otherwise end may elect to continue such benefits. The continuation can last up to 36 months.

## If A Covered Dependent Loses Eligibility

In general, if a Dependent child's group health benefits end due to his or her loss of Dependent eligibility as defined in this SPD, he or she may elect to continue such benefits. However, such Dependent child must be a Qualified Beneficiary. The continuation can last up to 36 months.

## Concurrent Continuations

If a covered spouse or other Dependent elects to continue his or her group health benefits due to a Covered Employee's termination of employment or reduction of work hours, the spouse and/or Dependents may elect to extend their 18 month or 29 month continuation period to up to 36 months, if during the 18 month or 29 month continuation period, either: (a) the spouse or Dependent becomes eligible for 36 months of group health benefits due to any of the reasons stated above; or (b) the Covered Employee becomes entitled to Medicare.

The 36 month continuation period starts on the date the 18 month continuation period started, and the two continuation periods will run concurrently.

## Special Medicare Rule

If a Covered Employee becomes entitled to Medicare before a termination of employment or reduction of work hours, a special rule applies for a covered spouse or Dependent. The continuation period for such covered Dependents, after such termination of employment or reduction of work hours, will be the longer of: (a) 18 months (or 29 months if the Disabled Qualified Beneficiaries provision applies) from such termination of employment or reduction of work hours; or (b) 36 months from the date of the Qualified Beneficiary's entitlement to Medicare.

## Notice Requirement

A person eligible for continuation under this section must notify the Employer, in writing, of: (a) a legal divorce or legal separation; or (b) the loss of a Child's Dependent eligibility, as defined in this SPD.

Such notice must be given to the Employer within 60 days of the later of: (a) the date of the event; or, (b) the date the Qualified Beneficiary would lose coverage.

## Employer's Responsibilities

The Employer must notify the Qualified Beneficiary, in writing, of: (a) his or her right to continue this Plan's group health benefits; (b) the monthly contribution he or she must pay to continue such benefits; and (c) the time and manner in which such monthly payments must be made.

Such written notice must be given to the Qualified Beneficiary within 44 days of: (a) the Covered Employee's death, Medicare eligibility, termination of employment or reduction of work hours; or (b) 14 days of the date the Employer receives notice, in writing, of the legal divorce or legal separation, or the loss of Dependent eligibility of a Covered Dependent child.

## Election Of Continuation Rights

To continue his or her group health benefits, the Qualified Beneficiary must give the Employer written notice that he or she elects to continue. A child's parent or legal guardian may elect continuation coverage on behalf of the child. The election must be made within: (a) 60 days of the date coverage would otherwise end if the election is not made; or, (b) if later, 60 days from the date the termination of coverage notice is issued by the Employer as described above.

The payments must be paid by the Qualified Beneficiary to the Employer, in advance, at the times and in the manner specified by the Employer.

The monthly payment will be a reasonable estimate of the cost of providing the group health benefits had the Qualified Beneficiary stayed covered under the Plan on a regular basis. It includes any amount that would have been paid by the Employer. In general, an additional charge of two percent (2%) of the total monthly charge also may be required by the Employer.

If the Qualified Beneficiary fails to give the Employer notice of his or her intent to continue, or fails to pay any required monthly payment in a timely manner, he or she waives continuation rights.

## Continuation Grace Period

A Qualified Beneficiary's contribution payment is timely if, with respect to the first payment after the Qualified Beneficiary elects to continue, such payment is made no later than 45 days after such election. In all other cases, contribution payment is timely if it is made within 31 days of the specified due date.

## When Continuation Ends

A Qualified Beneficiary's continued group health benefits end on the first of the following:

- 1. With respect to continuation upon termination of employment or reduction of work hours, the end of the 18 month period which starts on the date the group health benefits would otherwise end;
- 2. With respect to a disabled Qualified Beneficiary who has elected an additional 11 months of continuation, the earlier of: (1) the end of the 29 month period, which starts on the date the group health benefits would have otherwise ended; or (2) the first day of the month which coincides with or next follows the date which is 30 days after the date on which a final determination is made that a disabled Qualified Beneficiary is no longer disabled under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act;
- 3. With respect to continuation upon death, a legal divorce or legal separation, or the end of a Covered Dependent's eligibility, the end of the 36 month period which starts on the date the group health benefits would have otherwise ended;
- 4. With respect to a Covered Dependent whose continuation is extended due to the Special Medicare Rule provision, the end of the continuation period specified in that provision;
- 5. The date the Employer ceases to provide any group health plan to any Employee;
- 6. The end of the period for which the last monthly bill payment is made;
- 7. The date the Qualified Beneficiary first becomes covered under any other group health plan which does not contain any pre-existing condition exclusion or limitation affecting him or her; or
- 8. The date the Qualified Beneficiary first becomes entitled to Medicare.

## Address Change

If COBRA continuation coverage is elected, qualified beneficiaries must notify the Plan or the Plan Administrator of any address changes.

## Right to Elect Individual Coverage

There may be other coverage options for You and Your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through a 'special enrollment period.' Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov.

## Special Continuation Rights For Active Duty Military Personnel Under The Uniformed Services Employment And Re-Employment Rights Act ('USERRA')

Under this provision, an 'Eligible Person' means any person who at the time the Covered Employee leaves employment for active military duty, training, inspection for duty, or honorary military funeral duty ('active duty'), is covered for group health benefits under this Plan and is either: (a) an Employee who leaves employment for active duty; or (b) the spouse or Dependent child of the Covered Employee who is leaving for active duty and who is covered by the Plan as of the date the Covered Employee leaves employment for active duty.

## Group Health Benefits End

An Eligible Person may elect to continue his group health benefits for up to 24 months after the date on which such benefits would otherwise end because the Covered Employee leaves employment for active duty.

During the 24 month period, in the case of the death of the Covered Employee, a divorce from the Covered Employee, or a Dependent child otherwise becomes ineligible for coverage under the Plan, the spouse or Dependent child may continue their coverage until the end of the original 24 month period with the payment of the appropriate monthly payment. No additional months of coverage will be added to the original 24 month period due to such an event.

Additionally, coverage under this USERRA provision will run concurrently with, and be instead of, continuation coverage that would otherwise be available under COBRA.

## Eligible Person's Responsibilities

The Eligible Person must elect to continue group health benefits in writing and pay the first month's payment to the Employer no later than 31 days from date his or her group health benefits would otherwise end.

If the Eligible Person is given notice of this continuation right by the Employer after the date his or her coverage would otherwise end, the written election and payment must be received by the Employer no later than 31 days after the date of notification. Subsequent monthly contributions required by the Employer must be paid to the Employer in advance, at the times and in the manner specified by the Employer.

The Employer will consider an Eligible Person's failure to give this notice or to pay any required monthly contribution as a waiver of his or her continuation rights.

## The Employer's Responsibilities

At the time of employment, the Employer must notify the Covered Employee of his or her right to continue coverage.

At the time the Covered Employee goes on active duty, the Employer must notify each Eligible Person of: (a) his or her right to continue this Plan's group health benefits; (b) the monthly payment he or she must

(Rev. 08/2022)

make to continue such benefits; and (c) the times and manner in which such monthly payments must be made.

## The Monthly Payment

If the Covered Employee is on active duty for fewer than 31 days, he or she must pay the normal Covered Employee payment for the first month of coverage. Payment will be due by the end of the 31 days.

If the Covered Employee is on active duty for 31 days or more, he or she will be required to pay 102% of the full monthly payment under the Plan for each month, which represents the Employer's share plus the Covered Employee's share, plus 2% for administrative costs.

Payment of the initial payment must be made within 45 days of electing coverage. Thereafter, payment of a month's entire amount will be due on the first of each month. Payment that is not made within 31 days of the beginning of the month for which it is due will result in termination of coverage effective back to the first of the month that the payment was due. Any claims that were Incurred in such a month will be denied and a refund of payment will be sought if claims that were Incurred in that month were paid.

## When Continuation Ends

An Eligible Person's continued group health benefits end on the first of the following: (a) the date the Eligible Person is enrolled in another group plan that does not contain a pre-existing condition exclusion or limitation that impacts the eligible person, not including being covered under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services; (b) the end of the 24 month continuation period; (c) the beginning of the month for which the last monthly contribution payment was due but went unpaid; or (d) the date this Plan ends and is not replaced.

## When The Covered Employee Is Released From Active Duty

When the Covered Employee is released from active duty and timely returns to work for the Employer with whom he or she was employed when called to active duty, as required by USERRA, the Covered Employee and other eligible persons who were covered by this USERRA coverage will be reinstated in the Plan. No new Employment Waiting Period will be applied if coverage was continuous under this provision, except as set out below.

When the Covered Employee is released from active duty and returns to work for the Employer in a timely manner, as required by USERRA, and the Covered Employee's coverage was terminated during the Covered Employee's active service, coverage will be reinstated for the Covered Employee as well as for the spouse and Dependent child, if they were covered by the Plan at the time the Covered Employee went on active duty. No new Employment Waiting Period will be applied.

The Plan will exclude from coverage services for any Sickness or Injury determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to have been incurred in, or aggravated during, performance of active service in the uniformed services. The determination that the Covered Employee's Sickness or Injury was incurred in, or was aggravated during, the performance of service may only be made by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or his or her representative.

(Rev. 08/2022)

## XIV. OTHER PROVISIONS

## Plan Costs

The employer pays the balance of any premiums and administrative expenses out of its general assets. Where applicable, employee contributions toward the cost of coverage under the Plan are paid on a pre-tax basis through the Employer's cafeteria plan.

## Conformity With Federal Statutes

If this Plan, on its Effective Date, is in conflict with any applicable federal laws, it is changed to meet the minimum requirements of those laws. In the event that new or applicable federal laws are enacted which conflict with current provisions of this SPD, the provisions that are affected will be administered in accordance with the new applicable laws, despite anything in the SPD to the contrary.

## Enforcement Of Plan Provisions

Failure by Us to enforce or require compliance with any provision within this SPD will not waive, modify or render any provision unenforceable at any other time, whether the circumstances are the same or not.

## Required Data

You must furnish the Plan with all information with regard to this Plan that the Plan may reasonably require.

You may receive correspondence from the Employer or third-party administrator asking you to confirm or provide Social Security number information for your enrolled Dependents. Generally, Medicare requires the Plan's third-party administrators to provide this information to them electronically. To view the CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) ALERT, which provides information on the authority for requesting the Social Security number, visit www.cms.hhs.gov/MandatoryInsRep. Go to the Downloads section and select the June 23, 2008 ALERT.

The Employer must also obtain Social Security numbers for all enrolled Dependents to comply with new IRS reporting required by the Affordable Care Act.

## Rescission

The Employer reserves the right to rescind coverage for a Covered Employee and/or Dependent if that person performs an act, practice, or omission that constitutes fraud, or makes an intentional misrepresentation of material fact with respect to the requirements for Plan coverage. Rescission is a retroactive cancellation of coverage. The Employer can also retroactively terminate coverage in other circumstances, including but not limited to non-payment of premiums or failure to report a dependent's loss of eligibility.

Before rescinding coverage and solely to the extent required by the Affordable Care Act (the 'ACA'), the Employer will provide 30 days advance written notice of the rescission. However, the Employer can terminate medical coverage subject to the ACA without providing 30 days' advance written notice under certain circumstances permitted by the U.S. Department of Labor, including non-payment of premiums or failure to report a dependent's loss of eligibility.

(Rev. 08/2022)

## Assignment

Except for voluntary assignments to health care providers, as may be required by law or as may be provided in applicable policies, your right to receive benefits under the Plan may not be assigned, voluntarily or involuntarily, to any other person.

## Severability

If any clause or portion of this Health Care Plan Document and SPD is held invalid by a court of law or is otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this document shall not be invalid.

## Legal Action

No cause of action, claim, or suit in law or in equity, may be brought to recover benefits under this Plan until the exhaustion of administrative remedies.  You agree that You will not file a suit or legal action against Us for any breach of this agreement, or denial of benefits, without first submitting the dispute through the claims review process.  No cause of action, claim, or suit in law or in equity can be brought later than 18 months from the date of the alleged breach of this agreement or denial of benefits, regardless of any statute of limitations to the contrary.

(Rev. 08/2022)

## XV. STATEMENT OF ERISA RIGHTS

As a participant in the Plan, You are entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides that all Covered Persons shall be entitled to:

- 1. Receive Information About Your Plan And Benefits

Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations, such as worksites and union halls, all Plan documents, including: insurance contracts; collective bargaining agreements; and copies of all documents filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, such as detailed reports and SPD descriptions.

Obtain copies of all Plan documents, other Plan information and an updated SPD upon written request to the Plan Administrator. The administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies.

Receive a summary of the Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each Covered Person with a copy of this summary annual report.

- 2. Continue Group Health Plan Coverage

Continue health care coverage for You, Your Covered Dependents if there is a loss of coverage under the Plan as a result of a qualifying event. You or Your Covered Dependents may have to pay for such coverage. Review this SPD and the documents governing the Plan on the rules governing your COBRA continuation coverage rights.

## Prudent Actions By Plan Fiduciaries

In addition to creating rights for Covered Persons, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan. The people who operate your Plan, called ''fiduciaries'' of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of You and other Covered Persons and beneficiaries. No one, including Your Employer, Your union, or any other person, may fire You or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising Your rights under ERISA.

## Enforce Your Rights

If Your claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, You have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.

Under ERISA, there are steps You can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if You request materials from the Plan Administrator and do not receive them within 30 days, You may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay You up to $120 fine a day until You receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If You have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, You may file suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if You disagree with the Plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order or a medical Child support order, You may file suit in federal court.

If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if You are discriminated against for asserting Your rights, You may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or You may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If You are successful the court may order the person You have sued to pay these costs and fees. If You lose, the court may order You to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds Your claim is frivolous.

## Assistance With Your Questions

If You have any questions about Your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If You have any questions about this statement or about Your rights under ERISA, or if You need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in Your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about Your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

(Rev. 08/2022)

## XVI. NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES

This Notice Describes How Protected Health Information That Is Created Or Received By The Health Plan May Be Used And Disclosed And How A Covered Person Can Get Access To This Information. Please Review It Carefully.

A federal law called HIPAA requires that health plans and other covered entities (such as health care providers) protect the privacy of certain information. This Notice of Privacy Practices ('Notice') is intended to inform Covered Persons, in summary fashion, of their rights under HIPAA's privacy provisions and the HIPAA obligations imposed on the group health plan sponsored by their Employer ('Plan'). This Notice describes how protected health information ('PHI') may be used or disclosed by this Plan to carry out treatment, payment, health care operations, and for other purposes that are permitted or required by law. This Notice also sets out this Plan's legal obligations concerning a Covered Person's protected health information, and describes a Covered Person's rights to access, amend and manage that protected health information.

Any reference to 'We' or 'Us' means the Plan.

Only Protected Health Information ('PHI') is covered by this Notice. Protected Health Information is individually identifiable health information, including demographic information, that is collected from a Covered Person, or created or received by a health care provider, a health plan, an employer (when functioning on behalf of the group health plan), or a health care clearinghouse and that relates to: 1) a Covered Person's past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition; 2) the provision of health care to a Covered Person; or 3) the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to a Covered Person.

The Plan restricts access to PHI to those who 'need to know that information' to provide services to Covered Persons, or on behalf of Covered Persons. Health Information that a Covered Person's employer receives about the Covered Person as an employer (or in a capacity other than as administrator of the Plan) is not PHI. Thus, a Covered Person's sick leave records, FMLA leave information, drug testing results, Workers' Compensation files, disability, life insurance, and OSHA records are not PHI and are not covered by this Notice.

This Notice has been drafted to be consistent with what is known as the 'HIPAA Privacy Rule,' and any of the terms not defined in this Notice should have the same meaning as they have in the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

If You have any questions or want additional information about the Notice or the policies and procedures described in the Notice, please contact the 'Privacy Contact.' The Privacy Contact will be designated by your Employer in another document.

## Effective Date

This Notice of Privacy Practices becomes effective on January 1, 2014.

(Rev. 08/2022)

## The Plan's Responsibilities

The Plan is required by law to maintain the privacy of a Covered Person's PHI. The Plan is obligated to provide the Covered Person with a copy of this Notice of the Plan's: 1) legal duties; 2) rights and obligations under HIPAA regarding a Covered Person's PHI; 3) privacy practices with respect to such PHI; 4) obligation to abide by the terms of the Notice that is currently in effect; and, 5) obligation to notify the Covered Person in the event of a breach of the Covered Person's unsecured PHI.

The Plan reserves the right to change the provisions of this Notice and make the new provisions effective for all PHI that it maintains. If the Plan makes a material change to this Notice, a revised Notice will be mailed to the address that the Plan has on record.

Genetic information shall be treated as health information pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The use or disclosure by the Plan of protected health information that is genetic information about an individual for underwriting purposes under the Plan shall not be a permitted use or disclosure.

When using or disclosing PHI, or when requesting PHI from another covered entity, the Plan will make reasonable efforts not to use, disclose or request more than the minimum amount of PHI necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure or request, taking into consideration practical and technological limitations.

However, the minimum necessary standard will not apply in the following situations:

- · disclosures to, or requests by, a health care provider for treatment;
- · uses or disclosures made to the individual;
- · disclosures made to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services;
- · uses or disclosures that are required by law;
- · uses or disclosures that are required for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule; and
- · uses or disclosures made pursuant to an authorization.

This Notice does not apply to information that has been de-identified. De-identified information is health information that does not identify an individual and, with respect to which, there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual. It is not individually identifiable health information.

## Information Collected

The Plan may collect information directly from a Covered Person orally, or on an application or other form. The Plan also collects information from third parties, such as current or former health care providers, and consumer reporting agencies.

It is impossible to describe every type of information that may be collected, but here are some examples:

- · A Covered Person's name, age, address, Social Security number, telephone number, occupation, and other demographic information;
- · A Covered Person's history of other insurance coverage and applications (if applying online, information is collected through an Internet 'cookie,' an information-collecting device from a web server);

- · A Covered Person's past, present, or future physical, mental, or behavioral health or condition;
- · A Covered Person's health care history;
- · A Covered Person's prescription information; and,
- · Information about the Covered Person from consumer reporting agencies and data collection agencies.

## Permissible Uses And Disclosures Of PHI

This section describes how the Plan is most likely to use and/or disclose a Covered Person's PHI. Please note that this Notice does not list every use or disclosure, instead it gives examples of the most common uses and disclosures.

- · Treatment, Payment And Health Care Operations The Plan has the right to use and disclose a Covered Person's PHI for all activities that are included within the definitions of "treatment,' 'payment," and "health care operations" as described in the applicable HIPAA Privacy Rule. Generally, this means that the Plan may use Your PHI for the following purposes:

The Plan may use or disclose PHI so that a Covered Person may seek medical treatment. Treatment is the provision, coordination or management of health care and related services. It also includes, but is not limited to consultations and referrals between two or more of a Covered Person's providers. For example, the Plan may disclose to a treating specialist the name of a Covered Person's primary care physician so that the specialist may request medical records from that primary care physician. The Plan also may send health care information to doctors for patient safety or other treatment-related reasons.

The Plan may use and disclose PHI to pay claims for services provided to a Covered Person, and to obtain stop-loss reimbursements (if applicable), or to otherwise fulfill the Plan's responsibilities for coverage and providing benefits. For example, the Plan may disclose PHI when a provider requests information regarding a Covered Person's eligibility for coverage under this Plan, or the Plan may use PHI to determine if a treatment that was received was medically necessary. The Plan may also share PHI with a utilization review or pre-certification service provider. Likewise, the Plan may share medical information with another entity to coordinate payment of benefits (e.g., under the plan of the Covered Person's spouse). The Plan will also share PHI to assist with subrogation of a Covered Person's claims.

The Plan may use or disclose PHI to support its business functions. These functions include, but are not limited to: quality assessment and improvement; reviewing provider performance; licensing; stop-loss underwriting; cost management; business planning; and business development. For example, the Plan may use or disclose PHI: 1) to provide a Covered Person with information about a disease management program; 2) to respond to a customer service inquiry from a Covered Person; 3) in connection with fraud and abuse detection and compliance programs; 4) in connection with underwriting and soliciting bids from potential insurance carriers; 5) in connection with merger and acquisition activities; 6) in connection with setting monthly contributions, deciding employee monthly contributions, or submitting claims to the stop-loss (or excess loss) carrier; 7) to conduct or arrange for medical review; or, 8) in connection with legal services or audit services.

## Required Disclosures Of PHI

The following is a description of disclosures that the Plan is required by law to make.

- · Disclosures To The Secretary Of The U.S. Department Of Health And Human Services The Plan is required to disclose PHI to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services when the Secretary is investigating or determining the Plan's compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

## · Disclosures To Covered Persons

The Plan is required to disclose to a Covered Person most of the PHI in a 'designated record set' when that Covered Person requests access to this information. Generally, a designated record set contains medical and billing records, as well as other records that are used to make decisions about a Covered Person's health care benefits. The Plan also is required to provide, upon the Covered Person's request, an accounting of most disclosures of his PHI that are for reasons other than treatment, payment and health care operations and are not disclosed through a signed authorization.

The Plan will disclose a Covered Person's PHI to an individual who has been designated by that Covered Person as his personal representative and who has qualified for such designation in accordance with relevant state law. However, before the Plan will disclose PHI to such a person, the Covered Person must submit a written notice of his designation, along with the documentation that supports his qualification (such as a power of attorney).

Even if the Covered Person designates a personal representative, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the Plan to elect not to treat that individual as the Covered Person's personal representative if a reasonable belief exists that: 1) the Covered Person has been, or may be, subjected to domestic violence, abuse or neglect by such person; 2) treating such person as his personal representative could endanger the Covered Person; or, 3) the Plan determines, in the exercise of its professional judgment, that it is not in its best interest to treat that individual as the Covered Person's personal representative.

The Plan may use or disclosure PHI to other family members who are covered under the Plan regarding a Covered Person's care or payment related to the care. If a Covered Person objects to the use or disclosure of PHI in communications with other family members covered under the Plan, please contact the Privacy Contact identified on the first page of this Notice.

## · Business Associates

The Plan contracts with individuals and entities ('Business Associates') to perform various functions on its behalf, or to provide certain types of services. To perform these functions or to provide the services, the Plan's Business Associates will receive, create, maintain, use or disclose PHI, but only after the Plan requires the Business Associates to agree in writing to contract terms designed to appropriately safeguard PHI. For example, the Plan may disclose PHI to a Business Associate to administer claims or to provide service support, utilization management, subrogation or pharmacy benefit management. Examples of the Plan's Business Associates would be its third party administrator, broker, preferred provider organization, and utilization review vendor.

## · Other Covered Entities

The Plan may use or disclose PHI to assist health care providers in connection with their treatment or payment activities, or to assist other covered entities in connection with payment activities and

certain health care operations. For example, the Plan may disclose PHI to a health care provider when needed by the provider to render treatment to a Covered Person, and the Plan may disclose PHI to another covered entity to conduct health care operations in the areas of: fraud and abuse detection; compliance, quality assurance and improvement activities; or accreditation, certification, licensing or credentialing. This also means that the Plan may disclose or share PHI with other insurance carriers in order to coordinate benefits, if a Covered Person has coverage through another carrier.

## · Plan Sponsor

The Plan may disclose PHI to the Plan Sponsor of the group health plan for purposes of plan administration or pursuant to an authorization request signed by the Covered Person. Also, the Plan may use or disclose 'summary health information' to the Plan Sponsor for obtaining premium bids or modifying, amending or terminating the group health plan. Summary health information summarizes the claims history, claims expenses or types of claims experienced by individuals for whom a Plan Sponsor has provided health benefits under a group health plan and from which identifying information has been deleted in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

## · Plan Sponsor Personnel

The Plan may disclose PHI to certain employees of the Plan Sponsor ('Plan Sponsor Personnel'), who have been authorized by the Plan to receive PHI from or on behalf of the Plan, as necessary to perform certain Plan administration functions on behalf of the Plan. Plan Sponsor Personnel are subject to the same restrictions as the Plan, and in no event may Plan Sponsor Personnel use PHI for employment related purposes.

## Other Permissible Uses And Disclosures Of PHI

The following is a description of other possible ways in which the Plan may (and is permitted to) use and/or disclose PHI.

## · As Required By Law

The Plan may use or disclose PHI to the extent the federal, state or local law requires the use or disclosure. When used in this Notice, 'required by law' is defined as it is in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. For example, the Plan may disclose PHI when required by national security laws or public health disclosure laws.

## · Public Health Activities

The Plan may use or disclose PHI for public health activities that are permitted or required by law. For example, the Plan may use or disclose information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability, or it may disclose such information to a public health authority authorized to receive reports of child abuse or neglect. The Plan also may disclose PHI, if directed by a public health authority, to a foreign government agency that is collaborating with the public health authority.

## · Health Oversight Activities

The Plan may disclose PHI to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law, such as: audits; investigations; inspections; licensure or disciplinary actions; or civil, administrative, or criminal proceedings or actions. Oversight agencies seeking this information include government agencies that oversee: 1) the health care system; 2) government benefit programs; 3) other government regulatory programs; and 4) compliance with civil rights laws.

## · Abuse Or Neglect

The Plan may disclose PHI to a government authority that is authorized by law to receive reports of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. Additionally, as required by law, the Plan may disclose PHI to a governmental entity authorized to receive such information if there is reason to believe that the Covered Person has been a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.

## · Legal Proceedings

The Plan may disclose PHI: 1) in the course of any judicial or administrative proceeding; 2) in response to an order of a court or administrative tribunal (to the extent such disclosure is expressly authorized); and, 3) in response to a subpoena, a discovery request, or other lawful process, once the Plan has met all administrative requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. For example, the Plan may disclose PHI in response to a subpoena for such information, but only after first meeting certain conditions required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

## · Law Enforcement

Under certain conditions, the Plan also may disclose PHI to law enforcement officials. For example, some of the reasons for such a disclosure may include, but not be limited to: 1) it is required by law or some other legal process; 2) it is necessary to locate or identify a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person; or, 3) it is necessary to provide evidence of a crime.

## · Coroners, Medical Examiners, Funeral Directors, And Organ Donation Organizations

- Coroners, Medical Examiners, Funeral Directors, And Organ Donation Organizations The Plan may disclose PHI to a coroner or medical examiner for purposes of identifying a deceased person, determining a cause of death, or for the coroner or medical examiner to perform other duties authorized by law. The Plan also may disclose, as authorized by law, information to funeral directors so that they may carry out their duties. Further, the Plan may disclose PHI to organizations that handle organ, eye, or tissue donation and transplantation.

## · Research

The Plan may disclose PHI to a third party for purposes of research when: 1) individual identifiers have been removed; or 2) an institutional review board or privacy board has: (a) reviewed the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the privacy of the information; and (b) approved the research.

- · To Prevent A Serious Threat To Health Or Safety Consistent with applicable federal and state laws, the Plan may disclose PHI if there is reason to believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public. The Plan also may disclose PHI if it is necessary for law enforcement authorities to identify or apprehend an individual.

## · Military Activity And National Security, Protective Services

Under certain conditions, the Plan may disclose PHI if Covered Persons are, or were, Armed Forces personnel, for activities deemed necessary by appropriate military command authorities. If Covered Persons are members of foreign military service, the Plan may disclose PHI about foreign military personnel to the appropriate foreign military authority. The Plan also may disclose PHI to authorized federal officials for conducting national security and intelligence or counterintelligence, and for the protection of the President and other authorized persons or heads of state.

## · Inmates

If a Covered Person is an inmate of a correctional institution, the Plan may disclose PHI to the correctional institution or to a law enforcement official for: 1) the institution to provide health care to the Covered Person; 2) the Covered Person's health and safety and the health and safety of others; or 3) the safety and security of the correctional institution.

## · Workers' Compensation

The Plan may disclose PHI to comply with workers' compensation laws and other similar programs that provide benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses.

## · Emergency Situations

The Plan may disclose PHI of a Covered Person in an emergency situation, or if the Covered Person is incapacitated or not present, to a family member, close personal friend, authorized disaster relief agency, or any other person previous identified by the Covered Person. The Plan will use professional judgment and experience to determine if the disclosure is in the best interests of the Covered Person. If the disclosure is in the best interest of the Covered Person, the Plan will disclose only the PHI that is directly relevant to the person's involvement in the care of the Covered Person.

The Plan may also disclose PHI of a Covered Person to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that the Covered Person's family can be notified about the Covered Person's condition, status, and location.

## · Fundraising Activities

The Plan may use or disclose the PHI of a Covered Person for fundraising activities, such as raising money for a charitable foundation or similar entity to help finance its activities. If the Plan does contact the Covered Person for fundraising activities, the Plan will give the Covered Person the opportunity to opt-out, or stop, receiving such communications in the future.

## · Group Health Plan Disclosures

The Plan may disclose the PHI of a Covered Person to a sponsor of the group health plan - such as an employer or other entity - that is providing a health care program to the Covered Person. The Plan can disclose the PHI of the Covered Person to that entity if that entity has contracted with the Plan to administer the Covered Person's health care program on its behalf.

## · Underwriting Purposes

The Plan may use or disclose the PHI of a Covered Person for underwriting purposes, such as to make a determination about a coverage application or request. If the Plan does use or disclose the PHI of the Covered Person for underwriting purposes, the Plan is prohibited from using or disclosing in the underwriting process the PHI of the Covered Person that is genetic information.

## · Others Involved In Your Health Care

Using its best judgment, the Plan may make PHI known to a family member, other relative, close personal friend or other personal representative that the Covered Person identifies. Such use will be based on how involved the person is in the Covered Person's care or in the payment that relates to that care. The Plan may release information to parents or guardians, if allowed by law.

If a Covered Person is not present or able to agree to these disclosures of PHI, then, using its professional judgment, the Plan may determine whether the disclosure is in the Covered Person's best interest.

## Uses And Disclosures Of PHI That Require A Covered Person's Authorization

Other uses and disclosures of PHI that are not described above will be made only with the Covered Person's written authorization. If the Covered Person provides the Plan with such an authorization, the Covered Person may revoke the authorization in writing, and the revocation will be effective for future uses and disclosures of PHI. However, the revocation will not be effective for information that the Plan already has used or disclosed in reliance on the authorization.

## · Sale Of PHI

The Plan will request the written authorization of a Covered Person before the Plan makes any disclosure that is deemed a sale of the Covered Person's PHI, meaning that the Plan is receiving compensation for disclosing the PHI in this manner.

- · Marketing

The Plan will request the written authorization of a Covered Person to use or disclose the Covered Person's PHI for marketing purposes with limited exceptions, such as when the Plan has face-to-face marketing communications with the Covered Person, or when the Plan provides promotional gifts of nominal value.

- · Psychotherapy Notes

The Plan will request the written authorization of a Covered Person to use or disclose any of the Covered Person's psychotherapy notes that the Plan may have on file, with limited exception, such as for certain treatment, payment or health care operation functions.

## Potential Impact Of State Law

The HIPAA Privacy Regulations generally do not 'preempt' (or take precedence over) state privacy or other applicable laws that provide individuals greater privacy protections. As a result, to the extent a law applies, the privacy laws of a particular state, or other federal laws, rather than the HIPAA Privacy Regulations, might impose a privacy standard under which the Plan will be required to operate. The privacy laws of a particular state or other federal laws might impose a stricter privacy standard. If these stricter laws apply, the Plan will comply with the stricter law. For example, where such laws have been enacted, the Plan will follow more stringent state privacy laws that relate to uses and disclosures of PHI concerning HIV or AIDS, mental health, substance abuse/chemical dependency, genetic testing, reproductive rights, etc.

## A Covered Person's Rights

The following is a description of a Covered Person's rights with respect to PHI:

- · Right To Request A Restriction

A Covered Person has the right to request a restriction on the PHI the Plan uses or discloses about him/her for treatment, payment or health care operations. To request restrictions, a Covered Person must make a written request to the Privacy Contact identified on the first page of this Notice. In the request, the Covered Person must include: 1) what information he/she wants to limit; 2) whether he/she wants to limit the use, disclosure, or both; and 3) to whom the Covered Person wants the limits to apply-for example, disclosures to the Covered Person's spouse.

The Plan is not required to agree to any restriction that a Covered Person may request. If the Plan agrees to the restriction, it will comply with the restriction until it is revoked, or unless the information is needed to provide emergency treatment to the Covered Person.

## · Right To Request Confidential Communications

If a Covered Person believes that a disclosure of all or part of his/her PHI may endanger him/her, that Covered Person may request that the Plan communicates with him/her regarding PHI in an alternative manner, or at an alternative location. For example, the Covered Person may ask that the Plan only contact the Covered Person at a work address or via the Covered Person's work e-mail.

To request a restriction, the Covered Person must make a written request to the Privacy Contact identified on the first page of this Notice. This written request should inform the Plan: 1) that he/she wants the Plan to communicate his PHI in an alternative manner, or at an alternative location; and, 2) that the disclosure of all or part of this PHI in a manner inconsistent with these instructions would put the Covered Person in danger.

The Plan will accommodate a request for confidential communications that is reasonable, and that states that the disclosure of all or part of a Covered Person's PHI could endanger that Covered Person. As permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 'reasonableness' will (and is permitted to) include, when appropriate, making alternate arrangements regarding payment.

Accordingly, as a condition of granting a Covered Person's request, he/she will be required to provide the Plan information concerning how payment will be handled. For example, if the Covered Person submits a claim for payment, state or federal law (or the Plan's own contractual obligations) may require that the Plan disclose certain financial claim information to the Plan Participant under whose coverage a Covered Person may receive benefits (e.g., an Explanation of Benefits 'EOB'). Unless the Covered Person has made other payment arrangements, the EOB (in which a Covered Person's PHI might be included) will be released to the Plan Participant.

Once the Plan receives all the information for such a request (along with the instructions for handling future communications), the request will be processed usually within 2 business days or as soon as reasonably possible.

Prior to receiving the information necessary for this request, or during the time it takes to process it, PHI may be disclosed (such as through an EOB). Therefore, it is extremely important that the Covered Person contact the Privacy Contact as soon as the Covered Person determines the need to restrict disclosures of his/her PHI.

If the Covered Person terminates his request for confidential communications, the restriction will be removed for all of the Covered Person's PHI that the Plan holds, including PHI that was previously protected. Therefore, a Covered Person should not terminate a request for confidential communications if that person remains concerned that disclosure of PHI will endanger him/her.

## · Right To Inspect And Copy

A Covered Person has the right to inspect and copy PHI that is contained in a 'designated record set.' Generally, a designated record set contains medical and billing records, as well as other records that are used to make decisions about a Covered Person's health care benefits. However, the Covered

Person may not inspect or copy psychotherapy notes or certain other information that may be contained in a designated record set.

To inspect and copy PHI that is contained in a designated record set, the Covered Person must submit a written request to the Privacy Contact identified on the first page of this Notice. If the Covered Person requests a copy of the information, the Plan may charge a fee for the costs of copying, mailing or other supplies associated with that request.

The Plan may deny a Covered Person's request to inspect and copy PHI in certain limited circumstances. HIPAA provides several important exceptions to a Covered Person's right to access PHI. For example, a Covered Person will not be permitted to access psychotherapy notes or information compiled in anticipation of, or for use in, a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding. The Plan will not allow a Covered Person to access PHI if these or any of the exceptions permitted under HIPAA apply.

If a Covered Person is denied access to PHI, he/she may request that the denial be reviewed. To request a review, the Covered Person must contact the Privacy Contact identified on the first page of this Notice.

A licensed health care professional chosen by the Plan will review the Covered Person's request and the denial. The person performing this review will not be the same one who denied the Covered Person's initial request. Under certain conditions, the Plan's denial will not be reviewable. If this event occurs, the Plan will inform the Covered Person through the denial that the decision is not reviewable.

## · Right To Amend

If a Covered Person believes that his/her PHI is incorrect or incomplete, the Covered Person may ask the Plan to amend that information. The Covered Person may request that the Plan amend such information by submitting a written request to the Privacy Contact identified on the first page of this Notice. The request must list the specific PHI that needs amending, and explain why it is incorrect or incomplete.

In certain cases, the Plan may deny the Covered Person's request for an amendment. For example, the Plan may deny the request if the information the Covered Person wants to amend is not maintained by the Plan, but by another entity. In addition, the Plan may deny a request if the Covered Person asks the Plan to amend information that:

- § is not part of the medical information kept by or for the Plan;
- § was not created by the Plan or its third party administrators;
- § is not part of the information which the Covered Person would be permitted to inspect and copy; or
- § is accurate and complete.

If the Plan denies the request, they will provide a written explanation for the denial. The Covered Person has the right to file a written statement of disagreement with the Plan. This statement of disagreement will be linked with the disputed information, and all future disclosures of the disputed information will include this statement.

- · Right Of An Accounting

The Covered Person has a right to an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI that are for reasons other than treatment, payment or health care operations. An accounting will include the date(s) of the disclosure, to whom the Plan made the disclosure, a brief description of the information disclosed, and the purpose for the disclosure.

No accounting of disclosures is required for disclosures made pursuant to a signed authorization by the Covered Person or his personal representative. The Covered Person should know that most disclosures of PHI will be for purposes of payment or health care operations, and, therefore, will not be subject to this right.

There also are other exceptions to this right. For example, the accounting will not include: 1) disclosures made to friends or family in the presence of a Covered Person, or because of an emergency; 2) disclosures for national security purposes; or, 3) disclosures incidental to otherwise permissible disclosures.

To request an accounting of disclosures, a Covered Person must submit a written request to the Privacy Contact identified on the first page of this Notice. A Covered Person's request may be for disclosures made up to 6 years before the date of the request, but not for disclosures made before April 14, 2004. The first accounting requested within a 12-month period will be free. For additional lists of accounting, the Plan may charge for the costs of providing the list. The Plan will notify the Covered Person of the cost involved, and he/she may choose to withdraw or modify the request before any costs are incurred.

- · Right To Be Notified Of A Breach The Plan is required by law to maintain the privacy and security of PHI. A Covered Person will be promptly notified if a breach occurs that may have compromised the privacy or security of PHI.
- · Right To A Copy Of This Notice
- A Covered Person has the right to request a copy of this Notice by submitting a request to the Privacy Contact identified on the first page of this Notice. If a Covered Person has agreed to accept this Notice electronically, on the Plan's website or by electronic mail, he/she is also entitled to request a paper copy of this Notice at any time.

## Complaints

A Covered Person may complain to the Plan if he/she believes that the Plan has violated these privacy rights. The Covered Person may file a complaint with the Plan by contacting the Privacy Contact identified on the first page of this Notice. A copy of a complaint form is available from this contact office.

A Covered person may also file a complaint with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights by:

- 1. sending a letter to 200 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20201;
- 2. calling (877) 696-6775; or,
- 3. visiting the website at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/index.html.

Complaints filed directly with the Secretary must: 1) be in writing; 2) contain the name of the entity against which the complaint is lodged; 3) describe the relevant problems; and (4) be filed within 180 days of the time the Covered Person became, or should have become, aware of the problem.

The Plan will not penalize or in any other way retaliate against a Covered Person for filing a complaint with the Secretary or with the Plan.

## Changes To This Notice

The Plan reserves the right to make changes to this notice and to make the revised or changed notice effective for protected health information the Plan already has about You as well as any information the Plan receives or creates in the future. Any changes to this notice will be provided to You, and if the Plan makes substantial material changes to the notice, the Plan will distribute the revised notice to You.

- a. The treatment, services or supplies have a definite positive effect on health outcomes. Such evidence must include well-designed investigations that have been reproduced by non-affiliated authoritative sources, with measurable results, backed up by the positive endorsements of national medical bodies or panels regarding scientific efficacy and rationale; and
- b. Over time, the treatment, services or supplies lead to improvement in health outcomes which show that the beneficial effects outweigh any harmful effects; and
