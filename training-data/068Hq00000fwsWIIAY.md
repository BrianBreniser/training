Selection of a Primary Care Provider - your plan may require or allow the designation of a primary care provider. You have the right to designate any primary care provider who participates in the network and who is available to accept you or your family members. If your plan requires designation of a primary care provider, Cigna may designate one for you until you make this designation. For information on how to select a primary care provider, and for a list of the participating primary care providers, visit www.mycigna.com or contact customer service at the phone number listed on the back of your ID card. For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider.

Direct Access to Obstetricians and Gynecologists - You do not need prior authorization from the plan or from any other person (including a primary care provider) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care professional, however, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre-approved treatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating health care professionals who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, visit www.mycigna.com or contact customer service at the phone number listed on the back of your ID card.

## Additional Information

## Cigna Diabetes Prevention Program in collaboration with Omada

Cigna Diabetes Prevention Program in collaboration with Omada is a program to help you avoid the onset of diabetes, as well as health risks that might lead to heart disease or a stroke. The program is covered by your health plan at the preventive level, just like for your wellness visit. Program participants have access to a professional virtual health coach, an online support group, interactive lessons, and a smart-technology scale. The program will help you make small changes in your eating, activity, sleep, and stress to achieve healthy weight loss through a series of 16 weekly lessons and tools to help you maintain weight loss over time. You will also be offered the opportunity to join a gym for a low monthly fee and no enrollment fee.

## Maximum Reimbursable Charge

The allowable covered expense for non-network services is based on the lesser of the health care professional's normal charge for a similar service or a percentage of a fee schedule (110%) developed by Cigna that is based on a methodology similar to one used by Medicare to determine the allowable fee for the same or similar service in a geographic area. In some cases, the Medicare based fee schedule will not be used and the maximum reimbursable charge for covered services is based on the lesser of the health care professional's normal charge for a similar service or a percentile (80th) of charges made by health care professionals of such service or supply in the geographic area where it is received. If sufficient charge data is unavailable in the database for that geographic area to determine the Maximum Reimbursable Charge, then data in the database for similar services may be used. Out-of-network services are subject to a Calendar Year deductible and maximum reimbursable charge limitations.

## Out-of-Network Emergency Services Charges

- 1. Emergency Services are covered at the In-Network cost-sharing level as required by applicable state or federal law if services are received from a non-participating (Out-of-Network) provider.
- 2. The allowable amount used to determine the Plan's benefit payment for covered Emergency Services rendered in an Out-of-Network Hospital, or by an Out-ofNetwork provider in an In-Network Hospital, is the amount agreed to by the Out-of-Network provider and Cigna, or as required by applicable state or federal law.

The member is responsible for applicable In-Network cost-sharing amounts (any deductible, copay or coinsurance). The member is not responsible for any charges that may be made in excess of the allowable amount. If the Out-of-Network provider bills you for an amount higher than the amount you owe as indicated on the Explanation of Benefits (EOB), contact Cigna Customer Service at the phone number on your ID card.

## Medicare Coordination

In accordance with the Social Security Act of 1965, this plan will pay as the Secondary plan to Medicare Part A and B as follows:

- (a) a former Employee such as a retiree, a former Disabled Employee, a former Employee's Dependent, or an Employee's Domestic Partner who is also eligible for Medicare and whose insurance is continued for any reason as provided in this plan (including COBRA continuation);
- (b) an Employee, a former Employee, an Employee's Dependent, or former Employee's Dependent, who is eligible for Medicare due to End Stage Renal Disease after that person has been eligible for Medicare for 30 months.

When a person is eligible for Medicare A and B as described above, this plan will pay as the Secondary Plan to Medicare Part A and B regardless if the person is actually enrolled in Medicare Part A and/or Part B and regardless if the person seeks care at a Medicare Provider or not for Medicare covered services.

## One Guide

Available by phone or through myCigna mobile application. One Guide helps you navigate the health care system and make the most of your health benefits and programs.

## Out-of-Area Services

-  Coverage for services rendered outside a network area
-  ER and Ambulance paid the same as network services
-  Preventive care services covered at 100% for Out-of-Area
-  Out-of-Network Deductible and Out-of-Pocket maximums apply

## Complete Care Management

Pre-authorization is required on all inpatient admissions and selected outpatient procedures, diagnostic testing, and outpatient surgery. Network providers are contractually obligated to perform pre-authorization on behalf of their customers. For an out-of-network provider, the customer is responsible for following the preauthorization procedures. If a customer does not follow requirements for obtaining pre-treatment authorization, a $250 penalty will be applied.
