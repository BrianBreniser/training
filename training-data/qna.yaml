      ## Here's a more in-depth look at how Choice Plus works.

      ## Medical Benefits

      |                           | In Network   | Out-of-Network   |
      |---------------------------|--------------|------------------|
      | Annual Medical Deductible |              |                  |
      | Individual                | $3,000       | $6,000           |
      | Family                    | $6,000       | $12,000          |

      All individual deductible amounts will count toward the family deductible, but an individual will not have to pay more than the individual deductible amount.

      You're responsible for paying 100% of your medical expenses until you reach your deductible. For certain covered services, you may be required to pay a fixed dollar amount - your copay.

      | Annual Out-of-Pocket Limit   |         |         |
      |------------------------------|---------|---------|
      | Individual                   | $6,350  | $12,700 |
      | Family                       | $12,700 | $25,400 |

      All individual out-of-pocket maximum amounts will count toward the family out-of-pocket maximum, but an individual will not have to pay more than the individual out-of-pocket maximum amount.

      Once you've met your deductible, you start sharing costs with your plan - coinsurance. You continue paying a portion of the expense until you reach your out-ofpocket limit. From there, your plan pays 100% of allowed amounts for the rest of the plan year.

      Selection of a Primary Care Provider - your plan may require or allow the designation of a primary care provider. You have the right to designate any primary care provider who participates in the network and who is available to accept you or your family members. If your plan requires designation of a primary care provider, Cigna may designate one for you until you make this designation. For information on how to select a primary care provider, and for a list of the participating primary care providers, visit www.mycigna.com or contact customer service at the phone number listed on the back of your ID card. For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider.

      Direct Access to Obstetricians and Gynecologists - You do not need prior authorization from the plan or from any other person (including a primary care provider) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care professional, however, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre-approved treatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating health care professionals who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, visit www.mycigna.com or contact customer service at the phone number listed on the back of your ID card.

      Retail (per 90-day supply):
