      ## Here's a more in-depth look at how Choice Plus works.

      ## Medical Benefits

      |                           | In Network   | Out-of-Network   |
      |---------------------------|--------------|------------------|
      | Annual Medical Deductible |              |                  |
      | Individual                | $3,000       | $6,000           |
      | Family                    | $6,000       | $12,000          |

      All individual deductible amounts will count toward the family deductible, but an individual will not have to pay more than the individual deductible amount.

      You're responsible for paying 100% of your medical expenses until you reach your deductible. For certain covered services, you may be required to pay a fixed dollar amount - your copay.

      | Annual Out-of-Pocket Limit   |         |         |
      |------------------------------|---------|---------|
      | Individual                   | $6,350  | $12,700 |
      | Family                       | $12,700 | $25,400 |

      All individual out-of-pocket maximum amounts will count toward the family out-of-pocket maximum, but an individual will not have to pay more than the individual out-of-pocket maximum amount.

      Once you've met your deductible, you start sharing costs with your plan - coinsurance. You continue paying a portion of the expense until you reach your out-ofpocket limit. From there, your plan pays 100% of allowed amounts for the rest of the plan year.
