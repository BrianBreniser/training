|                No                       | Network coverage only You can usually save money when you receive care for covered health care services from network providers.                                                                                  |
|                Yes                      | Network and out-of-network benefits You may receive care and services from network and out-of-network providers and facilities - but staying in the network can help lower your costs.                           |
|                No                       | Primary care physician (PCP) required With this plan, you need to select a PCP - the doctor who plays a key role in helping manage your care. Each enrolled person on your plan will need to choose a PCP.       |
|                No                       | Referrals required You'll need referrals from your PCP before seeing a specialist or getting certain health care services.                                                                                       |
|                Yes                      | Preventive care covered at 100% There is no additional cost to you for seeing a network provider for preventive care.                                                                                            |
|                Yes                      | Pharmacy benefits With this plan, you have coverage that helps pay for prescription drugs and medications.                                                                                                       |
|                Yes                      | Tier 1 providers Using Tier 1 providers may bring you the greatest value from your health care benefits. These PCPs and medical specialists meet national standard benchmarks for quality care and cost savings. |
|                No                       | Freestanding centers You may pay less when you use certain freestanding centers - health care facilities that do not bill for services as part of a hospital, such as MRI or surgery centers.                    |
|                No                       | Health savings account (HSA) With an HSA, you've got a personal bank account that lets you put money aside, tax-free. Use it to save and pay for qualified medical expenses.                                     |

This Benefit Summary is to highlight your Benefits. Don't use this document to understand your exact coverage. If this Benefit Summary conflicts with the Certificate of Coverage (COC), Schedule of Benefits, Riders, and/or Amendments, those documents govern. Review your COC for an exact description of the services and supplies that are and are not covered, those which are excluded or limited, and other terms and conditions of coverage.

## Here's a more in-depth look at how Choice Plus works.

## Medical Benefits

|                           | In Network   | Out-of-Network   |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Annual Medical Deductible |              |                  |
| Individual                | $3,000       | $6,000           |
| Family                    | $6,000       | $12,000          |

All individual deductible amounts will count toward the family deductible, but an individual will not have to pay more than the individual deductible amount.

You're responsible for paying 100% of your medical expenses until you reach your deductible. For certain covered services, you may be required to pay a fixed dollar amount - your copay.

| Annual Out-of-Pocket Limit   |         |         |
|------------------------------|---------|---------|
| Individual                   | $6,350  | $12,700 |
| Family                       | $12,700 | $25,400 |

All individual out-of-pocket maximum amounts will count toward the family out-of-pocket maximum, but an individual will not have to pay more than the individual out-of-pocket maximum amount.

Once you've met your deductible, you start sharing costs with your plan - coinsurance. You continue paying a portion of the expense until you reach your out-ofpocket limit. From there, your plan pays 100% of allowed amounts for the rest of the plan year.

## Here's an example of how the plan's costs come into play.

<!-- image -->

## At the start of your plan year ..

## Once you reach your deductible.

## When you reach your out-of-pocket limit .

You're responsible for paying 100% of your covered health services until you reach your deductible; which is the amount you pay before your health plan pays a portion:

health plan starts to share a percentage of costs (the allowed amounts; excluding copays) for covered health care services with you\_this is your coinsurance. Your

plan covers your costs (the allowed amount) at 1009. Your out-of-pocket limit is the most you'll pay for covered health services in a plan year\_copays and coinsurance count toward this. Your

## YOU PAY 1009

YOUR PLAN PAYS 100%

YOU PAY 209*

## YOUR PLAN PAYS 80%

Along the way; you may also be required to pay a fixed amount (for example; 815)\_or copay\_for covered health care services; such as seeing a provider or purchasing a prescription: You pay 100% of the copay; usually when you receive the service:

- Your coinsuranc may vary by service. This example is for illustrative purposes only:

## Outpatient Prescription Drug Benefits

For Prescription Drug Products dispensed at a retail Network Pharmacy, you are responsible for paying the lowest of the following: 1) The applicable Copayment and/or Coinsurance; 2) The Network Pharmacy's Usual and Customary Charge for the Prescription Drug Product; and 3) The Prescription Drug Charge for that Prescription Drug Product. For Prescription Drug Products from a mail order Network Pharmacy, you are responsible for paying the lower of the following: 1) The applicable Copayment and/or Coinsurance; and 2) The Prescription Drug Charge for that Prescription Drug Product.

See the Copayment and/or Coinsurance stated in the Benefit Information table for amounts. We will not reimburse you for any non-covered drug product.

For a single Copayment and/or Coinsurance, you may receive a Prescription Drug Product up to the stated supply limit. Some products are subject to additional supply limits based on criteria that we have developed. Supply limits are subject, from time to time, to our review and change.

Specialty Prescription Drug Products supply limits are as written by the provider, up to a consecutive 31-day supply of the Specialty Prescription Drug Product, unless adjusted based on the drug manufacturer's packaging size, or based on supply limits, or as allowed under the Smart Fill Program. Supply limits apply to Specialty Prescription Drug Products obtained at a Preferred Specialty Network Pharmacy, a Non-Preferred Specialty Network Pharmacy, an out-of-Network Pharmacy, a mail order Network Pharmacy or a Designated Pharmacy.

Certain Prescription Drug Products for which Benefits are described under the Prescription Drug Rider are subject to step therapy requirements. In order to receive Benefits for such Prescription Drug Products you must use a different Prescription Drug Product(s) first. You may find out whether a Prescription Drug Product is subject to step therapy requirements by contacting us at myuhc.com or the telephone number on your ID card.

Before certain Prescription Drug Products are dispensed to you, your Physician, your pharmacist or you are required to obtain prior authorization from us or our designee to determine whether the Prescription Drug Product is in accordance with our approved guidelines and it meets the definition of a Covered Health Care Service and is not an Experimental or Investigational or Unproven Service. We may also require you to obtain prior authorization from us or our designee so we can determine whether the Prescription Drug Product, in accordance with our approved guidelines, was prescribed by a Specialist.

Certain Preventative Care Medications may be covered at zero cost share. You can get more information by contacting us at myuhc.com or the telephone number on your ID card.

Benefits are provided for certain Prescription Drug Products dispensed by a mail order Network Pharmacy or Preferred 90 Day Retail Network Pharmacy. The Outpatient Prescription Drug Schedule of Benefits will tell you how mail order Network Pharmacy and Preferred 90 Day Retail Network Pharmacy supply limits apply. Please contact us at myuhc.com or the telephone number on your ID card to find out if Benefits are provided for your Prescription Drug Product and for information on how to obtain your Prescription Drug Product through a mail order Network Pharmacy or Preferred 90 Day Retail Network Pharmacy.
