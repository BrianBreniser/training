      Selection of a Primary Care Provider - your plan may require or allow the designation of a primary care provider. You have the right to designate any primary care provider who participates in the network and who is available to accept you or your family members. If your plan requires designation of a primary care provider, Cigna may designate one for you until you make this designation. For information on how to select a primary care provider, and for a list of the participating primary care providers, visit www.mycigna.com or contact customer service at the phone number listed on the back of your ID card. For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider.

      Direct Access to Obstetricians and Gynecologists - You do not need prior authorization from the plan or from any other person (including a primary care provider) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care professional, however, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre-approved treatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating health care professionals who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, visit www.mycigna.com or contact customer service at the phone number listed on the back of your ID card.

      -  Home Delivery - up to 90-day supply (except Specialty up to 30-day supply)
      -  If you receive a supply of 34 days or less at home delivery of a Specialty Prescription Drug, the Specialty home delivery cost share will be adjusted to reflect a Retail (per 30-day supply) cost share.

      Retail (per 30-day supply): Generic: You pay $10 Preferred Brand: You pay $50 Non-Preferred Brand: You pay $75

      Retail (per 90-day supply):

      -  Retail drugs for a 30 day supply may be obtained In-Network at a wide range of pharmacies across the nation although prescriptions for a 90 day supply (such as maintenance drugs) will be available at select network pharmacies.
      -  This plan will not cover out-of-network pharmacy benefits.
      -  Cigna 90 Now Program: You can choose to fill your medications in a 30- or 90-day supply. If you choose to fill a 30-day prescription, it can be filled at any network retail pharmacy or network home delivery pharmacy. If you choose to fill a 90-day prescription, it must be filled at a 90-day network retail pharmacy or network home delivery pharmacy to be covered by the plan.
      -  Specialty medications are used to treat an underlying disease which is considered to be rare and chronic including, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C or rheumatoid arthritis. Specialty Drugs may include high cost medications as well as medications that may require special handling and close supervision when being administered.
      -  When you request a brand drug, you pay the brand cost share plus the cost difference between the brand and generic drugs up to the cost of the brand drug (unless the physician indicates "Dispense As Written" DAW) (MAC B).
      -  Exclusive specialty home delivery: Specialty medications must be filled through home delivery; otherwise you pay the entire cost of the prescription upon your first fill. Some exceptions may apply.
